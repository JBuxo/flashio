# Flashio

Flashio is a simple project I built to learn **Supabase** and **Framer Motion**.  
Itâ€™s not a production-level app â€” just a playground where I experimented and tested ideas.

Itâ€™s a **gamified XP-based game** featuring **Clever Shards** as the in-game currency.  
Clever Shards are required to purchase packs, while XP is required to unlock them.  
Packs are organized into tiers â€” from **Basic** to **Mythic** â€” each increasing in difficulty.  

Questions are generated via a simple **OpenAI API** call.  
Iâ€™ve preloaded the project with some credits, so it should work for a while.

## Features

<!-- Add your feature list here -->
**Pack system**: Flashcards are organized into packs in order Basic -> Apprentice -> Advanced -> Elite -> Mythic -> Legendary

**XP/Rewards**: users earn clever-shards and XP for opening packs and answering the questions. The rewards are based on performance.

**Unlocking logic**: packs require reaching certain XP tiers represented by big badge on the top of the screen

**UI**: I decided to go for a more retro-like feel with sharp corners since everything is "smooth and modern" nowadays. I avoided bland colors and the traditional "modern" deisgn.

**Gamification loop**: Instead of just selecting a topic and answering questions, the pack system felt a  bit more interesting

**Responsive web-based interface** (thought tested on my phone and the devtools im not sure if its super responsive)

## Architecture & Stack
- Supabase
- Nextjs w/ typescript
- Zustand
- Tailwind
- ShadCN/ui (though It wasnt used that much)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+  
- npm or yarn  
- Supabase project (with credentials)  
- OpenAI API key
  
### Installation & Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JBuxo/flashio.git
cd flashio
npm install
```
### Running Locally
```bash
npm run dev
```
Then visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app.

## Configuration / Environment Variables
Create a ```.env.local``` file in the project root and include:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=...
```

## Data Model (brief)
The Supabase Table definitions are like this. 

```sql
-- This version is safe to run in Supabase or PostgreSQL.

-- 1. USERS TABLE (depends on auth.users existing in Supabase)
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.users (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES auth.users (id),
  created_at timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  xp integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  clever_shards integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
);

-- 2. SESSIONS TABLE (depends on users)
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.sessions (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id uuid REFERENCES public.users (id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  created_at timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  pack text, -- changed from USER-DEFINED to text (string for pack name or type)
  xp_rewarded smallint NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  clever_shards_rewarded smallint NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
);

-- 3. FLASHCARDS TABLE (depends on sessions)
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.flashcards (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  created_at timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  question_number smallint NOT NULL,
  question text,
  answer text,
  is_correct boolean DEFAULT false,
  session_id uuid REFERENCES public.sessions (id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

Make sure to enable cascde for the Delete User to work properly

## Usage / Interactions
The user flow is super simple.
1. User signs up with a magic link, so no passwords to remember
2. Once in, the user is allowed to open only the packs they have unlocked via their xp, an error message will show if the clever-shard cost is not met
3. User opens a pack and is presented with their cards. Correct cards swish left, wrong cards swish right.
4. A completion screen is shown with rewards summary
5. Back to home, then rinse and repeat.
6. Users can enter their sessions through the navigation dropdown and get a look-back of their sessions
7. Users can enter their profile and see their cumulative stats, or delete their account

## Future / TODOs
<!-- Add upcoming improvements or ideas here -->
1. Possible add GameSession persistence to allow users to continue games, currently whatever answers are not answered are set to false
2. Nicer better state handling, feels a bit messy but im not a pro
3. Allow topics of interest so users can get trivia for just one topic

## Contributing
I suggest **forking the repo first** and testing your changes in your own environment.  
No stress â€” Iâ€™ve kept a private copy of the project, so feel free to explore, modify, or break things while learning.
